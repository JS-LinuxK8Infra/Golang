## Deployments
**Summary:** This section covers anything misc related to this project, such as compiler installation and version validation.

- 2025-09-04 Install Go compiler locally and validate version.

## Code
**Summary:** This section includes all Go code written - also includes any applicable troubleshooting.

- 2025-09-30 Defines an array and assigns values to all 3 strings. Defines a second array and assigns values to all 4 int. Defines a third array and assigns values to all 4 strings. Defines a fourth array, assigns values to all 3 strings, prints the name of the array, calls the element from index 2 (plums), also (array indexing) replaces the element at index 0 with another string and prints the updated array. Assign ints to an 8 element array, then runs a for loop through the ints provided until reaching the end. Defines a fifth array, forloop through the array and provides the element with the corresponding index location. Defines a sixth array, multidimensional - 2D, specifies the number of indexes as well as the number of elements per index, then calls the desired element from the specified index. `arrays.go`

- 2025-09-30 Output of arrays code.  
  ![cde1-1](Code/cde1-1.jpg)
- 2025-10-03 **TROUBLESHOOTING: The subslice was calling the original array defined in the code that has string elements, not integers, and was slicing more elements then are defined.**
  ![cde1-2](Code/cde1-2.jpg)
- 2025-10-03 **TROUBLESHOOTING: This array error is calling an index that is out of bounds of the element range in the array.**
  ![cde1-3](Code/cde1-3.jpg)
- 2025-10-03 **TROUBLESHOOTING: len() was not included in the code for the array.**
  ![cde1-4](Code/cde1-4.jpg)
- 2025-10-03 **TROUBLESHOOTING: This array error is calling an index that is out of bounds of the element range in the array.**
